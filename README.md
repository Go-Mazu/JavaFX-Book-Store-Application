# JavaFX-Book-Store-Application

This is a bookstore application I made as for a class project for object oriented design. By using a combination of Java, FXML, and SceneBuilder the project came together rather smoothly. I would highly reccomend using SceneBuilder if you're a visual learner like I am, it makes it easier to see and edit the pages you create, as well as seamlessly link buttons or fields between your code and the page you design.
